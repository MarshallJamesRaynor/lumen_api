 * Description:  The Eloquent ORM included with Laravel provides a beautiful,
 *      simple ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database.
 *      Each database table has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that table.
 *      Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as insert new records into the table.

 * Requirements: PHP5 or above
